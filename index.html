                    I was at Mozart's Coffee waiting for my friend Lolita when, all of the sudden, this tiny-animal-dog-thing runs up and starts attacking Charlotte (my Great Dane). Being completely docile, Charlotte did nothing in response and a few seconds later the most attractive man I had ever seen came running after the tiny animal. He looked amazing in his Star Trek shirt, and I immediately knew I would fall for him. He sat next to me explaining that his parents were inside getting coffee. The next four hours passed in an instant as I met Jesse, his parents, and Saki. The rest, as they say, is history.

                    My parents and I went to Mozart's after I took the Lawyer's Oath and officially became a licensed attorney. I had been to Mozart's several times before and wanted to show it to my parents. As I walked up to an empty table, I could not help but notice the giant-bear-dog trying to play with Saki. Being completely docile, Saki attempted to play with the beast with her spins and play barks. Embarassed that my dog was so loud, I quickly apologized to the beautiful woman trying to control her dog. With the greatest charm imaginable, she stated that our dogs must be flirting, so we had no choice but to get married. My parents soon came back and I introduced Randi as my fiance. The rest, as they say, is history.

                    I asked Randi to marry me on June 1, 2016, around noon at Mozart's. June 1st was our two year anniversary, so we both took the day off from work. Randi thought we were just spending the day together. I knew that I was making permanent arrangements for the rest of our lives. I got down on one knee and placed the ring box on the table. I said, "two years ago, on the day we met, you asked me to marry you. This time, I'm asking you for real. Will you marry me?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    ... Silence. No answer. A lifetime in a moment. ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Randi blinked, looked at me, and with a giant smile on her face, she said "yes," "I love you," and "of course!"
